### Remaining Useful Life Kit

## Vision & Mission

### Vision

Calculating Remaining Useful Life is a business.

The *Remaining Useful Life* Kit aims at novel business models based on the calculation of *Remaining Useful Life*. The wide range of possible applications starts with product development and finally extends to recycling: the entire product life cycle offers potential. The *Remaining Useful Life* Kit provides efficient support in planning, designing, building, using and operating *Remaining Useful Life* Services and applications based on them.

### Mission

The *Remaining Useful Life* Kit comes with the necessary Catena-X standards for damage models and remaining useful life statements. On this basis, interoperable solutions are created. The KIT includes tools for the simple implementation of component-specific damage models and for linking the damage models with dynamic input data. All components are easily adaptable to specific applications and simplify the journey to the finished service.



### Customer Journey

With the *Remaining Useful Life* Kit, we support the Catena-X customer journey for our adopters and solutions providers.

## Business Value

Through the standardized specifications described in the *Remaining Useful Life* Kit  – for example the semantic models and APIs – application and service providers can reduce investment and implementation costs to integrate new Catena-X services. Furthermore, application, data, model and service providers can enter potential new markets within the entire product life cycle.

<!-- !Mandatory! -->
## Use Case

- OEM, TIER-X: In the early development phase, components can be designed using digital prototypes based on component-specific damage calculation. The load data required for this comes from simulation or measurement in the digital twin.

- Tier-X: The overall product range becomes more attractive in the offer phase when model-based damage calculation is included as a product-related service.

- During the usage phase, OEMs, car dealers and automotive clubs can further interpret the *Remaining Useful Life* calculation for a vehicle evaluation and offer it as vehicle-related services for their end customers and fleet operators.

- Even during the usage phase, but particularly during the recycling phase, OEMs, Tier-X, automotive clubs, car dealers, insurers, fleet operators and recyclers benefit from precise residual value analyses of the entire vehicle and its components on the basis of component-specific damage calculation.


### Status Quo 

Within company limits, the calculation of component damage based on internally available data and models is already state of the art. However, across company boundaries, there are only individual, complex and not generally available options for calculating component-specific damage.

### Today’s challenge

For successful implementation, the following challenges must be addressed:

- the correct allocation of the appropriate damage calculation to the respective component
- recording and providing the necessary input variables
- an easy-to-interpret preparation of results
- easy scalability across company boundaries

### Benefits

**OEMs and big suppliers** benefit from cost savings, improved quality and shorter development times through customer-data-based, precise design of individual components and the entire system. The decisive hub is created by using load data and damage models across company boundaries — always in compliance with IP and data protection.

It will be easier for **SMEs** to use product-related *Remaining Useful Life* services, for example for design and recycling.

Generating added value by providing *Remaining Useful Life* services offers new areas of business for **solution providers**. These can be the suppliers themselves, pure service providers or so-called value-added resellers (VAR).

Here is a preview of our **standard candidates**: <!-- Link to be provided-->
- CX - 0059 Triangle Behavioral Twin Endurance:

  _This triangle document acts as a bracket for single standards required to request "Remaining Useful Life
(RUL)" data as well as providing a service for its calculation at a component level. Included are APIs to be
provided by the service provider and the service requestor, as well as aspect models for the respective
payloads being exchanged in an asynchronous pattern leveraging those APIs._

- CX - 0088 Aspect Model User Estimated Loading: 

  _This document describes the semantic model "User Estimated Loading" used in the
Catena-X network._

- CX - 0089 Triangle BehaviourTwin EnduranceEstimator:

  _This triangle document acts as a bracket for single standards required to request "Remaining Useful Life
(RUL)" data as well as providing a service for its estimation. Included are APIs to be provided by the service
provider and the service requestor, as well as aspect models for the respective payloads being exchanged in
an asynchronous pattern leveraging those APIs._

- CX - 0090 API EnduranceEstimator :

  _This documentation describes the technical specification to enable the request of standardized "Remaining
Useful Life (RUL)" data for "User Estimated Loading" and its integration into the Eclipse Dataspace connector
(EDC). It covers exclusively the illustration of the specific API endpoints. The minimal process an application
needs in order to support such interaction will not be handled here._
